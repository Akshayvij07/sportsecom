# Clean Architecture using Golang with Gin framework

## Template Structure

- [Gin](github.com/gin-gonic/gin) is a web framework written in Go (Golang). It features a martini-like API with performance that is up to 40 times faster thanks to httprouter. If you need performance and good productivity, you will love Gin.
- [JWT](github.com/golang-jwt/jwt) A go (or 'golang' for search engine friendliness) implementation of JSON Web Tokens.
- [GORM](https://gorm.io/index.html) with [PostgresSQL](https://gorm.io/docs/connecting_to_the_database.html#PostgreSQL)The fantastic ORM library for Golang aims to be developer friendly.
- [Wire](https://github.com/google/wire) is a code generation tool that automates connecting components using dependency injection.
- [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) is a complete configuration solution for Go applications including 12-Factor apps. It is designed to work within an application, and can handle all types of configuration needs and formats.
- [swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) converts Go annotations to Swagger Documentation 2.0 with [gin-swagger](https://github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger) and [swaggo files](github.com/swaggo/files)
